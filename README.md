# **Decentralized Data Marketplace**  

## 🚀 Introduction  
**Decentralized Data Marketplace** is a blockchain-powered platform that enables secure and transparent data sharing. Users can buy, sell, and tokenize datasets using smart contracts, ensuring ownership and privacy without intermediaries.

## ✨ Features  
- 🔐 **Secure Data Transactions** – End-to-end encryption and blockchain-based verification.  
- 💰 **Tokenized Data Exchange** – Trade data assets via smart contracts.  
- 🌍 **Decentralized Network** – No central authority; data is stored securely across nodes.  
- 📊 **User-Friendly Dashboard** – Intuitive interface to browse, list, and purchase datasets.  
- 🏦 **Crypto Payments** – Integrated with **Metamask** for seamless transactions.
